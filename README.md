# dw1000arduinonetwork
For our computer engineering capstone project. Takes a number of DW1000s hooked up to Arduinos and has them transmit their range information to each other and to serial interfaces. For use with our other projects.

Code is intended to run on an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V. See https://github.com/thotro/arduino-dw1000 for the core code used, as well as the final report at https://github.com/DrewBarclay/ARLocationTracking for more information.
